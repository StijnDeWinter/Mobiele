Stuff that still needs to happen:
-it's impossible to enter a patientname at the moment
    -method "addListenerOnButton()" in "MainActivity.java" needs to be changed for this
-when a test is completed it needs to be written away to a file
-every time data on completed questionings are requested, they should be read from the file containing that data
-way to order all the completed questionings in the file system

option:

#number of questionings?
